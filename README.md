# CLPS Final
 
 Hi CLPS 0950 Teaching Team!
 
 I hope you have a good time looking through our project!
 
 I would like to mention a few important things to check in our Repo!
 
 1. Checkers.m is one of the main Matlab code function files that we run!
 2. The "WORK LOG" - because we had quite a few issues with pushing and pulling with matlab, Shiven and I have been keeping track of our work through a google doc. We put the     pdf in the ReadMe for you to see as well!
 3. CLPS Final Presentation - this is the presentation we presented on Friday. It has our program approach, skills learned, and logic implemented!

 It is our apologies for not reaching out earlier for help on our code, but we got a little too swamped with other subjects and tried to tackle the code on our own. I hope       that the functionality we were able to show was useful. Thank you all for your help and consideration!
 
 Best,
 Shrey and Shiven
